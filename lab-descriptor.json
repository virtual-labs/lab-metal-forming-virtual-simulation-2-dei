  "introduction": "This Virtual Lab is a continuation of Metal Forming Virtual Simulation Lab-I. The Metal Forming Virtual Simulation Lab (Processes) – II is a web-based laboratory designed to deepen students’ understanding of advanced metal forming and post-forming processes through interactive simulations. This lab focuses on deformation-based manufacturing techniques used for producing components with improved mechanical properties, dimensional accuracy, and surface finish, as well as the study of common process-related defects. The experiments cover key industrial operations such as rolling, ring rolling, thread rolling, wedge rolling, cogging, swaging, riveting, quenching, stamping, and the analysis of forging defects. Through these simulations, learners can observe material flow patterns, deformation characteristics, thermal effects, and defect formation while studying the influence of process parameters in a safe, repeatable, and cost-effective virtual environment.",
